# pdfmder

A tiny Python package + CLI (Typer) that will become a PDF → Markdown converter.

## Install

Once published to PyPI, you’ll be able to run it via uvx:

```bash
uvx pdfmder
```

(You mentioned `uvx.sh/pdfmder` — we can add that once the project is published and you want the installer page/script set up.)

## Usage

```bash
pdfmder
# -> Hello world
```
